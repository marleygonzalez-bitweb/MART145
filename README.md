    <h1>My Interests: Gaming and Basketball</h1>

    <p>
      Two of my biggest passions are <strong>gaming</strong> and <strong>basketball</strong>.
      Both give me a sense of excitement, competition, and teamwork — whether I’m on the court
      or in an online match with friends.
    </p>

    <h2>Gaming: Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Halo</h2>

    <p>
      I’ve been a fan of first-person shooters for years.
      Games like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Battlefield</em>, and <em>Halo</em> let me experience intense
      action, strategy, and collaboration.
      Each series has its own style:
      Call of Duty focuses on fast-paced gameplay,
      Battlefield offers large-scale warfare with vehicles,
      and Halo combines sci-fi adventure with amazing multiplayer battles.
      Gaming also helps me connect with friends and relax after a long day.

    <h2>Basketball: My Favorite Sport</h2>

    <p>
      When I’m not gaming, I love playing basketball. It’s a sport that challenges both the mind and body,
      requiring teamwork, focus, and quick decision-making.
      I enjoy the energy of fast breaks, the precision of shooting, and the teamwork it takes to win a game.
      Basketball keeps me active and reminds me of the value of persistence and cooperation —
      qualities that help me both in sports and in life.
